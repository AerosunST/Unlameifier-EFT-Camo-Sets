HOLD ON, STOP!! WAIT!! YOU *NEED* TO READ THIS BEFORE CONTINUING!

FIRSTLY THIS REQUIRES UNLAMEIFIER, WITHOUT IT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENABLE CAMO. GET IT HERE: https://github.com/AerosunST/the_villain_arc9_unlameifier

Now, with that out of the way. Here's how you use this:

Step 1, do not install this directly into your Garry's Mod. It is not a singular addon. It is a folder containing multiple legacy addons. Open the folder, then copy all of the folders that are nested into this one into your Garry's Mod's addons folder. It's a little assbackwards, I know. I didn't want to see what happens when you merge everything into one folder.

Step 2A, make sure you're subscribed to the respective addons you are adding camo support for... Otherwise these are just taking up 2GB of your storage device doing nothing.

Step 2B, if you have legacy addon versions of these SWEPs... Do not directly paste the addons into your addons folder. Instead, merge the materials folder from these files into their respective pack.

Step 3, if you did everything above correctly... Go into Garry's Mod and load up a map so you can take out an EFT weapon. Open up the customization menu and go into your Custom Slot. The Camo attachment will be found in the Unlameifier folder. From there, you are now able to select your camo.

If I have wildly fucked something up on *my* end, please for the love of God let me know. I didn't stay up all night doing this for it to *not* work. Thank you.
